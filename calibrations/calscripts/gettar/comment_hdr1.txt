     Here are a couple of files that summarize the observer’s comments at the telescope for
all the HETDEX shots.  The first, “status_summary.txt”, lists shot date, shot number,
and the acceptance status for each dither (separated by colons).  The code letters are

                A - Accept
                B - Accepted but boarderline for some reason
                E - Rejected by RA due to equipment failure
                H - Rejected by RA due to human error
                W - Rejected by RA due to weather
                T - PI rejects due to poor track choice (late in track or incomplete track)
                
The second file “comment_summary.txt”,  lists the observers comments:  the columns 
are shot date, shot number, the beginning DIMM measurements for each dither,
the ending DIMM measurements for each exposure, and the telescope comments
for each dither, separated by colons.
